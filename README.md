# Project Description
## Food-Saver
Food Saver is an app aimed to reduce food waste by allowing people to post food to give away and connecting people to resources for food. Once you are logged in, you can fill out a card with information about the food you are giving away and also upload an image for people to view. You can delete posts you've created and filter for the type of food you wish to find. 

The app can be viewed at <https://food-saver-35a64.firebaseapp.com/>. 

## Technical Description
This project is bootstrapped with Create React App and uses Firebase Hosting. The app supports multiple, interdependent interactions.

Team Members: Phung Phu and Alex Park.

## Skills:
- Create a React project and use Firebase Hosting.
- Perform client-side routing using `react-router`.
- Use Firebase's realtime database and storage system to persist data, saving information between sessions so that data is available across multiple routes and interactions.
- Perform user authentication and save user accounts to Firebase's authentication system.
- Structure a web page using `React Components`.
- Use React `props` and `state` to make a web page interactive by supporting multiple `event handlers` and passing data between components as props, and using state to keep track of any dynamic values.
- Write event callback functions and use `arrow functions` and `public class fields` in order to keep the `this` reference in scope.
- Program with `JavaScript`, working with `objects`, `arrays`, `anonymous callback functions`, `looping`, `mapping`.
- Use components from external libraries such as `reactstrap` for building the app.
- Send a request using `fetch()`, then process the response through asynchronous programming by chaining `promises` using `.then()`.
- App is accessible and supports screen readers by rendering semantic HTML, ensuring visual elements have appropriate `alt` or `aria` attributes and label elements.
- Add styling with `CSS`.
- Use `Node` and `npm` to install packages.
- Run `live-server` for testing `AJAX` requests in the local web server.
